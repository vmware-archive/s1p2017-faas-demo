== JDBC Writer Demo

To install MySQL Helm chart run the following from the root directory of these demos:

```
./scripts/install-mysql
```


From the `functions/jdbc-writer/` directory, run the following to build and deploy the function:

```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
./mvnw clean package
docker build -t projectriff/jdbc-writer:1.0.0 .
k apply -f jdbc-writer.yaml
```

Publish some data messages from the `projectriff/riff` directory:

```
./publish data '{"name": "Mark", "description": "hello"}'
./publish data '{"name": "Jurgen", "description": "hello, again"}'
```

Log in to MySQL and query the `data` table. Run the following from the root directory of these demos:

```
./scripts/mysql
mysql> select * from data;
+----+--------+--------------+
| id | name   | description  |
+----+--------+--------------+
|  1 | Mark   | hello        |
|  2 | Jurgen | hello, again |
+----+--------+--------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> exit
Bye
```

Tear it all down by running:

```
kubectl delete functions/jdbc-writer
kubectl delete topics/data
```
